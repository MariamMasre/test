### Learn the fundamentals of a good developer mindset in 15 minutes

##### The desire to succeed may be part of our innate genes. Success will make people happy, and everyone strives for happiness. When we are happy, the chemicals in our brain explode into positive emotions, inspiring us to achieve greater success.               A successful career usually refers to the launch of a high-quality, recognized business within a specified time. This is no different for IT developers. Successful developers can write high quality code within the estimated scope and satisfy stakeholders by releasing great products.              To be honest, if you google "Good Habits of Programmers" there will be a lot of articles that look similar in your eyes.But today I want to explore this topic from a slightly different perspective. It is not about how to be better at programming, but how to make programmers more competitive in the market.           Don't misunderstand what I mean above. Being better at programming is sure to make programmers make more money. But this improvement may eventually be affected by diminishing marginal returns. Some practical ways I would like to talk about today, when programmers ask for a salary increase or look for a new job, and failure to do so can lead to a huge explosion in profits.
